The purpose of this project is to develop an Android application to digitalize a portion of the transportations system in Sudan. Enabling customers and drivers to find each other automatically for faster and easier transportations. 


The application is developed on java, supporting Android operating system devices with Android 4.0 or above. It consists of two parts, customer and driver. The interface is designed using modern techniques for ease of use and clarity. 


It is built using Google Maps API, accompanied by other Google provided APIs. It provides essential functions ensuring seamless and error free interactions, supporting driver account sign up, searching for places, driver tracking, navigation using google maps navigation, and a feedback system. 


Data is stored in a MySQLi Database provided by a back end as a service to ensure reliable, and fast reaction times. PHP language is used to send JSON format data between different clients.  

Here are some videos of the application in action:
